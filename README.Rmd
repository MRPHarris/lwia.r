## LWIA R

This package provides functions for the import and analysis of files generated by the Los Gatos Research (LGR) Liquid Water Isotope Analyser (LWIA) post-processing software ('LWIA Post Analysis'). 

This package is not remotely offical and is in no way endorsed by ABB, LGR, or any related companies. 

Built using files generated from the LWIA Post Analysis software version 4.5.0.6 (03/17/2017), derived from discrete water isotope measurements conducted on a LWIA-24d at the UNSW Sydney Biological Earth and Environmental Sciences (BEES) ice laboratory (E26 4006).
