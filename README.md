## LWIA R

This package provides functions for the import of files generated by the
Los Gatos Research (LGR) Liquid Water Isotope Analyser (LWIA)
post-processing software (‘LWIA Post Analysis’). This is specific to
analysers operating in discrete measurement mode. Basic cleaning of
resulting data (removal of water rinse/controls and standards) is also
incorporated.

This package is not official and is in no way contributed to or endorsed
by ABB, LGR, or any related companies.

Built using files generated from the LWIA Post Analysis software version
4.5.0.6 (03/17/2017), derived from discrete water isotope measurements
conducted on a LWIA-24d at the UNSW Sydney Biological Earth and
Environmental Sciences (BEES) ice laboratory (E26 4006).
